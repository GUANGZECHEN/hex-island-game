## Task 00-03 approved decisions

D006: The website may be public; private rooms require a valid invitation or capability, and the website URL alone grants no private-room access.
D007: Evaluate Cloudflare Workers and SQLite-backed Durable Objects for signaling and temporary room coordination; keep actual game traffic peer-to-peer through WebRTC where practical.
D008: The intended game-state architecture is host-authoritative; implementing game state is outside Task 00-03.
